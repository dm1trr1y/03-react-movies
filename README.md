This is a simple app that allows our user to find a movie by the input keywords in the search bar. When we get an input from user, we can make a GET response to [TMDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) and then with gained material (JSON object), we create a list of cards with movie title, link etc.
